Description: Back health Pomodoro timer with enforced full-screen breaks
 SpineGuard uses a modified Pomodoro technique designed around back health.
 Every 25 minutes, a full-screen overlay appears prompting you to take a
 break. Breaks alternate between walking and lying down to encourage
 movement, relieve pressure, and counteract prolonged sitting.
 .
 Features include guided exercise routines, sit-stand desk mode, water and
 supplement reminders, idle detection, and multi-monitor support.
